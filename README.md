# To Run:

npm install

My thoughts on this challenge: I had a little trouble
understanding the wording on who should be the one to confirm
the request. I spent about 2.5 hours on this and didnt get to
cleaning up the code or handling any styling. I think I spent
too much time trying to get all of the success criterea instead
of showing clean reusable best practice code. Hopefully that
isnt a big mark against me. My original idea was a bit too
complex for such a short time window which I think ended up
hurting me in the end.
